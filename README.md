# 📒 AddressBookApp

> A Spring Boot based Java application developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) to progressively design and implement a digital Address Book system. The project emphasizes incremental development, layered architecture, and progressive feature expansion to build a scalable and maintainable contact management system.

### 📖 Overview

- Modular Spring Boot project focused on modelling and managing Address Book contacts with structured storage and retrieval capabilities.
- Organized around incremental Use Cases evolving from basic contact creation to advanced features such as search, sorting, persistence, and database integration.
- Emphasizes clean architecture using Controller–Service–Repository layers along with progressive feature additions.
- Focuses on maintainability, testability, and scalable project structure as the application grows.

### ✅ Implemented Features

> _Features will be added here as Use Cases are implemented._

- 🧩 **UC1 – Create Contact :**
  - Introduces the core **Contact domain model** representing an individual entry in the Address Book.
  - Defines essential contact attributes including **first name, last name, address, city, state, zip, phone number, and email**.
  - Establishes the foundational data structure that all future Address Book operations will manipulate.

  **Purpose**
  - To define a structured representation of a contact within the Address Book system.
  - To provide the base entity required for adding, editing, searching, and persisting contact information in later use cases.

  **Implementation**
  - Implemented a `Contact` model class within the **model layer** of the application.
  - Encapsulates all contact fields with appropriate constructors and accessor methods.
  - Added **unit tests (`ContactTest`)** to validate object creation and ensure correctness of stored contact attributes.
  - Establishes the foundational domain object used by future **service, repository, and controller layers**.

### ⚙️ Development Approach

> This project follows an incremental **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** workflow:

- Tests are written first to define expected behaviour.
- Implementation code is developed to satisfy the tests.
- Each Use Case introduces new functionality in controlled steps.
- Existing behaviour is preserved through continuous refactoring.
- The system evolves through layered architecture using Controller, Service, and Repository separation.
- Progressive enhancements introduce search, sorting, persistence, multithreading, and database support.
