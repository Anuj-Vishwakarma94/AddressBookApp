### ⚙️ Development Approach

> This project follows an incremental **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** workflow:

- Tests are written first to define expected behaviour.
- Implementation code is developed to satisfy the tests.
- Each Use Case introduces new functionality in controlled steps.
- Existing behaviour is preserved through continuous refactoring.
- The system evolves through layered architecture using Controller, Service, and Repository separation.
- Progressive enhancements introduce search, sorting, persistence, multithreading, and database support.
